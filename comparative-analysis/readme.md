This folder contains the raw data used for the manuscript entitled "A comparative study of existing quality measures for process discovery", consisting of

1.  systems: .pnml files describing 15 process models used as systems. A system is identified with 2 numbers, e.g. 1_5
2.  logs: various logs (.xes) generated by the systems with differing levels of completeness and noise. 

The logfiles have a name of the form X_Y_Z_M_N where 
- X_Y refers to the system
- Z refers to the completeness (1 = 100% complete, 2 = 75% complete, ... 4 = 25% complete)
- M is an id, which indicate different simulation of a log, ranging from 1 till 5
- N refers to the noise (0 = no noise, 1 = 5% noise, 2 = 10% noise, 3 = 15% noise)

For more information, we refer to the manuscript

3.  models: various models (.pnml) discovered from the logs. 

The models have a similar naming schema as the logs, refering to the log they were discovered from, but the algorithm used is added to the name.

4. Computational results: for each combination of model and log, different quality metrics.
